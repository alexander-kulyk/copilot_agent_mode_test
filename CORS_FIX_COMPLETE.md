# 🔧 CORS Error Fixed! 

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error has been successfully fixed!

### 🐛 What Was The Problem?

- The deployed GitHub Pages app was trying to access `http://localhost:5000` (local backend)
- Browsers block cross-origin requests from HTTPS (GitHub Pages) to HTTP (localhost)
- This caused CORS errors and prevented the app from working on GitHub Pages

### 🛠️ How It Was Fixed

Updated `todo-app/src/services/todoApi.ts` with smart environment detection:

```typescript
// Automatically detects if running on GitHub Pages
const isGitHubPages = window.location.hostname.includes('github.io');
const isProductionBuild = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const DEMO_MODE = isGitHubPages || isProductionBuild;
```

### 🚀 New Behavior

**GitHub Pages (Demo Mode)**:
- ✅ Uses localStorage for data persistence
- ✅ No API calls to external servers
- ✅ All CRUD operations work perfectly
- ✅ Includes sample demo data
- ✅ Simulates network delays for realistic feel

**Local Development**:
- ✅ Uses backend API at `http://localhost:5000`
- ✅ Real-time data synchronization
- ✅ Full backend integration
- ✅ Data persisted in `todos.json`

### 🎯 Features Working Now

Your live app now includes:
- ✅ **Add Todos** - Create new tasks
- ✅ **Toggle Completion** - Mark complete/incomplete  
- ✅ **Delete Todos** - Remove tasks
- ✅ **Drag & Drop** - Reorder todos
- ✅ **Data Export** - Download as JSON
